	etcdLong  string = `etcd command connects to the etcd cluster and watches
for changes according to the options that you specified as flags.

--endpoints is a list of node addresses in the form of host:port where etcd is running

--username and --password must be both not empty if your cluster has authentication
mode enabled. Otherwise, you can leave both empty if you are allowing guest users to
use your cluster (not recommended!). 

--prefix is a string that will be placed before each query and specifies that your service
registry objects, i.e. Namespaces, Services and Endpoints, all have keys that start with
these values. If you have authentication mode enabled, make sure your user has enough
permissions for the cnwan-reader to do its job: it must have read access to this prefix.`
