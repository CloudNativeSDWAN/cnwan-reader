For this to work, a valid region must be provided with --region and the
aws credentials must be properly set.

Unless a different credentials path is defined with --credentials-path,
$HOME/.aws/credentials on Linux/Unix and %USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials on
Windows will be used instead. Alternatively, credentials path can be set
with environment variables. For a complete list of alternatives, please
refer to AWS Session documentation, but, to keep things simple, we suggest you
use the default one.`
