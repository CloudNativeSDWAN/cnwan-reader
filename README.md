CN-WAN Reader watches a service registry for changes and sends events to an
external handler for processing.

The CN-WAN Reader is part of the Cloud Native SD-WAN (CN-WAN) project.
Please check the [CN-WAN documentation](https://github.com/CloudNativeSDWAN/cnwan-docs)
for the general project overview and architecture.
You can contact the CN-WAN team at [cnwan@cisco.com](mailto:cnwan@cisco.com).

## Overview

The CN-WAN Reader makes use of the [service discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery)
pattern by connecting to a service registry and observing changes in published
services/endpoints. Detected changes are then processed and sent as events to
an *adaptor*, which can be created following the `OpenAPI` specification
included in this repository.

Please follow this readme to know more about *OpenAPI*, *Adaptors* and
*Supported Service Registries*.

## Supported Service Registries

Currently, the CN-WAN Reader can discover services/endpoints published to
Google Cloud's [Service directory](https://cloud.google.com/service-directory).

In order to connect correctly, a
[service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) is
needed.  
To learn more about Google Cloud Service Accounts, you can also consult
[this guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).
Finally, you can read Service Directory's [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/service-directory/docs)
to know more about how it works.

## Documentation

To learn how to install or use the program, please follow documentation
provided in the [docs](./docs) directory.

You can start by reading [Installation](./docs/installation.md) or
[Docker Installation](./docs/docker_installation.md) if you want to install and
run the program inside a docker container.

## OpenAPI Specification

The CN-WAN Reader acts as a *client*, sending detected changes in form of
events to an external handler - an *Adaptor* - for processing. Therefore, any
program interested in receiving and processing these events must generate the
*server* code starting from the OpenAPI specification, or you can just
implement the appropriate endpoint in your already existing server.

The specification, along with documentation on what you need to implement
and what data is sent by the CN-WAN Reader, is included in this repository
at this [link](./api/README.md).

To learn more about OpenAPI please take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).  
To generate your code, you can use the [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).
